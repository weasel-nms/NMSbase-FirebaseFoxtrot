## Instructions for importing this base are [here](https://github.com/weasel-nms/NMSbase--Instructions)

### Description:
A round base core with teleporter and decorative elements, non-functional turrets on the roof, surrounded by horizontal hexagonal	tunnels leading to six landing areas with railings.
	
### Part Count:
1251

### Positioning:
Ground

### Terrain Assumptions:
Flat - the base is fairly large, needed relatively large flat area. Minimally, the highest point should be in the center to avoid structures being underground.

### Powerlines:
Wired, no power source

### Helpful Information:
The base computer is located directly under the center of the main round structure.	Power requirements are 298 kps, largely due to the use of gas extractors as decorative elements; to avoid the need for 12 solar panels, 6 batteries and interconnecting wires, EM power is recommended, but not necessary.
